Description: An implementation of classifier chains for multi-label prediction.
    Users can employ an external package (e.g. C50, randomForest), or supply
    their own. The package can train a single set of CCs or train an ensemble
    of CCs -- in parallel if running in a multicore environment. New
    observations are classified using a Gibbs sampler since each unobserved
    label is conditioned on the others. The package includes methods for
    evaluating the predictions for accuracy and aggregating across iterations
    & models to make final binary or probabilistic classifications.
