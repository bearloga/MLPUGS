Description: An implementation of classifier chains for multi-label prediction.
    Users can take advantage of the built-in C++ classification engines, use a
    package (e.g. C50, randomForest), or supply their own. The package can
    train a single set of CCs or train an ensemble of CCs -- in parallel if
    running in a multicore environment. New observations are classified using
    a Gibbs sampler since each unobserved label is conditioned on the others.
    The package includes methods for evaluating the predictions for accuracy
    and aggregating across iterations & models to make final binary or
    probabilistic classifications.
