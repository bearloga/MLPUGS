Description: An implementation of classifier chains for multi-label prediction.
    Users can employ an external package (e.g. C50, randomForest), or supply
    their own. The package can train a single set of CCs or train an ensemble
    of CCs -- in parallel if running in a multicore environment. New
    observations are classified using a Gibbs sampler since each unobserved
    label is conditioned on the others. The package includes methods for
    evaluating the predictions for accuracy and aggregating across iterations
    and models to make final binary or probabilistic classifications.
